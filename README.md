# AI_Predict_Biocapacity_in_LatinAmerica
This repository contains a dataset tailored for neural network-based prediction. The methodology employed is thoroughly explained in the paper titled "Artificial Intelligence in Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint Prediction in Latin America and the Caribbean".


Some of the key attributes of predictions derived from time series data using neural networks lie in their capacity to offer consistency and stability, particularly within the framework of Latin American countries. This coherence and stability become apparent through an analysis of the autocorrelation inherent in each time series, revealing discernible patterns of partial autocorrelation, as depicted in the accompanying graphs.

Partial autocorrelation is a prevalent phenomenon observed in time series characterized by fluctuations, such as the annual growth and decline observed in metrics like biocapacity or ecological footprint. This form of autocorrelation reflects the ongoing dynamics of regeneration and decay associated with these metrics. The intrinsic capability of neural networks to capture these fluctuations is evident through their reliance solely on previous values of the time series, even when considering a substantial number of preceding terms. This enables them to effectively forecast these patterns, even as the correlation between terms diminishes over time.

The neural network's adeptness in recognizing immediate growth trends over time, as well as derivatives, not only underscores its adaptability to the phenomena but also determines the agility and precision of these forecasts. Moreover, it underscores how Latin America's biocapacity and ecological footprint, while not directly correlated in magnitude, often exhibit coordination in correlations or disparities in emissions and biocapacity patterns. These intricate patterns can be challenging for humans to discern but can be effectively identified through machine learning methodologies.
